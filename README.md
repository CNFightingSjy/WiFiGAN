# WiFiGEN

> Indoor imaging is a critical task for robotics and internet-of-
things. WiFi as an omnipresent signal is a promising can-
didate for carrying out passive imaging and synchronizing
the up-to-date information to all connected devices. This is
the first research work to consider WiFi indoor imaging as a
multi-modal image generation task that converts the measured
WiFi power into a high-resolution indoor image.
Our proposed WiFi-GEN network achieves a shape recon-
struction accuracy that is 275% of that achieved by physical
model-based inversion methods. Additionally, the Fr´ echet
Inception Distance score has been significantly reduced by
82%. To examine the effectiveness of models for this task,
the first large-scale dataset is released containing 80,000
pairs of WiFi signal and imaging target. Our model ab-
sorbs challenges for the model-based methods including the
non-linearity, ill-posedness and non-certainty into massive
parameters of our generative AI network. The network is also
designed to best fit measured WiFi signals and the desired
imaging output. For reproducibility, we will release the data
and code upon acceptance.
